# Introduction

`{tilemakr}` is a package for R that creates custom tile map data for...anything. Turn a matrix layout into coordinates that feed {ggplot2} layers.

If you've ever wanted to adopt the US tile map design for your own layout, this package is for you.

# Getting Started

To get started with the package, install using `remotes`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github(
  "adambushman/tilemakr", 
  dependencies = TRUE, 
  build_vignettes = TRUE
)
```

Once installed, load the package using the `library` command below or reference individual components using the `::` framework:

```{r}
# Load the entire library into the session

library(tilemakr)
```

You'll find helpful functions for turning custom layouts into plot able data frames in {ggplot2}.

# About Tile Maps

Tile maps are an incredible alternative to traditional, geographically true shape file maps. When geographic shape, scale, and relationships aren't the primary focus of a visualization, tile maps step in to let the true focus shine.

By standardizing size and shape, they allow the real variables of interest to be the star of the show. The most common versions are square and hexagon tile maps of the United States:

![Square Tile Map](https://images.presentationgo.com/2020/09/Square-Tile-Grid-Map-USA-PowerPoint.png) ![Hexagon Tile Map](https://images.presentationgo.com/2020/09/Hex-Tile-Grid-Map-USA-PowerPoint.png)

This popular example features existing, public resources for quick reproduction. But if a tile map was needed for the states of Mexico, the nations of Europe, or a convention center layout, there are few if any tools to help...until `{tilemaker}`.

# Creating a Tile Map

## Starting With a Layout

Creating a tile map for a custom layout starts with a grid design in matrix form. Look at this simple example:

```{r}
layout = matrix(
  data = c(
    "A", 0, 0, "B", 
    0, "C", "D", "E", 
    0, 0, "F", 0, 
    0, "G", 0, 0
  ), 
  byrow = TRUE, 
  nrow = 4, 
  ncol = 4
)
```

What we have here is a 4x4 grid defining the layout and names of the elements for which to draw our shapes. Each layout used in `{tilemakr}` functions follows the following principles:

-   Every position in the layout has a value
-   Every position intended for a tile needs a unique name/ID ("A", "B", ...)
-   Every position intended to be an empty region without a tile must contain a zero (0)

For experimenting with `{tilemakr}`, you can utilize the demo data housed right in the package, stored as elements within the `demo_data` list object. Access with base R syntax:

```{r}
# Using '$' notation
layout <- demo_data$`Example Matrix`

# Using '[[]]' notation
layout <- demo_data[["Example Matrix"]]
```

If your layout exists in a data frame or other tabular structure that's not a matrix, consider using the `tabular_to_matrix()` function (example shown in [Tile map tricks](#tricks)).

## Layout to Data Points

With our layout defined properly, we can quickly generate the data necessary for drawing the tile map by calling the `make_tiles()` function and passing it the `layout` variable containing our matrix. It will return us a data frame we can use in conjunction with {ggplot2}.

We need only pass the layout and specify the shape of tile we want to draw:

```{r warning=FALSE}
layout_data = make_tiles(layout, "square")

str(layout_data)
```

The data frame has (x,y) coordinates for drawing the polygon. {ggplot2} will use the *id* field to properly group the coordinates to their respective shape groups. We also get (center_x,center_y) coordinates useful for plotting the tile names or other data point we may care about.

The `make_tiles()` function currently supports 'square', 'hexagon', 'circle', and 'diamond' tile shapes. You can preview what tiles shapes look like with one of the demo data layouts by calling `preview_shapes()`:

```{r}
preview_shapes()
```

## Visualizing the tile map

With our layout now in the form of coordinates in a data frame, we can call `plot_tiles()` to get a quick view of the tile map data. It returns a basic, yet versatile, {ggplot2} object:

```{r warning=FALSE}
hex_layout <- make_tiles(layout, "hexagon")

plot_tiles(hex_layout)
```
Alternatively, we can call {ggplot2} geoms in the traditional workflow to plot the tile map data:

```{r warning=FALSE}

# Install {ggplot2} if needed
# install.packages('ggplot2')

ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::geom_polygon(
    ggplot2::aes(x, y, group = id), 
    # Our data goes here
    data = hex_layout, 
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  ggplot2::geom_text(
    ggplot2::aes(center_x, center_y, label = id), 
    # We remove the extra (x,y) entries to only plot the tile name once each
    data = unique.data.frame(hex_layout[,c("center_x", "center_y", "id")]), 
    color = "white"
  ) +
  ggplot2::coord_equal()
```

# Tile map tricks {#tricks}

### Converting layout data types

When designing custom layouts, you might find it easier to start with a tabular data set. Excel, for example, could offer a quick, natural design experience. You could then read the saved .CSV file into your R session without headers. 

What you'll have is a data frame or tibble but you can quickly get to a matrix using `tabular_to_matrix()`:

```{r}
layout <- demo_data[["Example Matrix"]]

# Currently a data frame
class(layout)

# To matrix
matrix_layout = tabular_to_matrix(layout)

# Now it's a matrix
class(matrix_layout)
```

### Customizing the tile map data

We can do some additional customization of our tile maps, like setting the *size* and *padding* arguments to non-standard values:

```{r warning=FALSE}
layout_data = make_tiles(layout, type = "square", size = 5, padding = 5)

ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::geom_polygon(
    ggplot2::aes(x, y, group = id), 
    # Our data goes here
    data = layout_data, 
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  ggplot2::coord_equal()
```

We can apply all kinds of layers to further style and customize the plot: scaling the fill by a variable, adding annotations, changing the theme, adding labels, and more.

### Joining with other data

We can also join (merge) the tile map data points with our own data sets. This can be useful for better labeling or, in the case below, we've added a gradient fill to our tiles, scaling with a joined variable *sales*.

```{r}
new_data <- 
  merge(
    layout_data, 
    demo_data[["Sales Data"]], 
    by = "id"
  )

ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::geom_polygon(
    ggplot2::aes(x, y, group = id, fill = sales), 
    # Our data goes here
    data = new_data
  ) +
  ggplot2::geom_text(
    ggplot2::aes(center_x, center_y, label = id), 
    # We remove the extra (x,y) entries to only plot the tile name once each
    data = unique.data.frame(new_data[,c("center_x", "center_y", "id")])
  ) +
  ggplot2::coord_equal()
```

# Ready Tile Layouts

This package contains some ready-made matrix layouts. From popular country's states to European nations, each matrix can be loaded in short order using `tile_layouts()`:

```{r}
euro_layout <- tile_layouts[["European Countries"]]

euro_data <- make_tiles(euro_layout, "hexagon")

plot_tiles(euro_data)
```

# Possibilities

The immediate applications are obvious. We could take any country's states/provinces and quickly generate a custom data set of tiles. More broadly, we could apply the same principles and process to any grid style layout, geographic or not (i.e. convention floor layout of booths).

Below is an example of a production quality visualization which directly implemented the functionality of this package. Review the source code [here](https://github.com/adambushman/tidytuesday-contribs/tree/main/wk27-23_historical-markers).
